        <h1 text-align: justify>Property Values and Neighborhood Characteristics in Santa Monica</h1>
        <h3 text-align: center>The factors determining the housing value have been a popular research topic 
                               in both academic and business field. These factors can be generalized to three 
                               different aspects: Housing Characteristics, Demographic Factors and Geographical 
                               Variables. A housing property is more variable if it is newly built and located in 
                               decent neighborhood. In this project, the geographical section will be specified 
                               and the other elements will be considered as control variables for the housing 
                               price evaluation. After controlling demographic and property characteristics, 
                               I am particularly interested in the effect of accessibility to commercial 
                               services to the property values. The following map penal shows the neighborhood characteristics
                               for median property value, median income, median square footage of the buildings
                               , and the traveling distance to the commercial districts. The right line graph display the
                              property values of commercial and residential buildings in each percentile.</h3>

          The distribution of the residential properties is very different from the commercial one. The magnitude
          of the difference is enlarged for the properties in higher percentiles. The marginal effect on property 
          value from building profitability is higher than the one from improvement in living qualities.

          The distribution of property values have slightly changed over time in Los Angeles County. We do not observe significant
          difference in the shape of the distribution where it is normally distributed with wide spread of extreme
          high-valued properties. Moreover, the median value of the whole county grown from 270,000 to 310,000 between
          2014 and 2018.

          Santa Monica region in Los Angeles County is an appropriate case for the project for several reasons. Firstly, 
          public regional railway system in Greater Los Angeles Area is limited, and automobile remains the most common 
          way for transportation. Thus, the average traveling time of Uber could be a close approximation. Secondly, 
          the heavy industry with pollution which negatively affects the housing price is negligible. On the contrary, 
          the existence of startup tech companies in the region might be positively correlated to the housing price. 
          By concluding the above information, properties are expected to be more valuable if they are closer to commercial 
          districts after demographic and housing patterns are controlled. The main purpose of this project is to test this 
          hypothesis and discover the distribution of the effects. You are welcome to discover more details in the report
          from the following link and interactive panel.
