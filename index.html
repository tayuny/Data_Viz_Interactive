        <h1 text-align: justify>Property Values and Neighborhood Characteristics in Santa Monica</h1>
        <h3 text-align: center>The factors determining the housing value have been a popular research topic 
                               in both academic and business field. These factors can be generalized to three 
                               different aspects: Housing Characteristics, Demographic Factors and Geographical 
                               Variables. A housing property is more variable if it is newly built and located in 
                               decent neighborhood. In this project, the geographical section will be specified 
                               and the other elements will be considered as control variables for the housing 
                               price evaluation. After controlling demographic and property characteristics, 
                               I am particularly interested in the effect of accessibility to commercial 
                               services to the property values. The following map penal shows the neighborhood characteristics
                               for median property value, median income, median square footage of the buildings
                               , and the traveling distance to the commercial districts. The right line graph display the
                              property values of commercial and residential buildings in each percentile.</h3>
